      You probably use personal identification numbers, passwords, or
      passphrases every day. All passwords provide access to private information
      such as bank account, medical history, messages, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed
      specific guidelines for strong passwords. According to NIST guidance, you
      should consider using the longest password or passphrase permissible (8-64
      characters) when you can. For example, "Pattern2baseball#4mYmiemale!"
      would be a strong password because it has 28 characters and includes the
      upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. You may need
      to try different variations of a passphrase for example, some applications
      limit the length of passwords and some do not accept spaces or certain
      special characters. Avoid common phrases, famous quotations, and song
      lyrics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you come up with a strong, memorable password it is tempting to reuse
      it; DO NOT! Reusing a password, even a strong one, endangers your accounts
      just as much as using a weak password. If attackers guess your password,
      they would have access to your other accounts with the same password.
